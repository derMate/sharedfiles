ISEA Poster: 
  The ISEA poster shows a selected experiment from my master thesis (Towards Predictive Musculoskeletal Simulations of Over-Actuated Human Lumbar Spine Models Using Deep Reinforcement Learning).
  It was presented at the ISEA 2024 which was held at the Loughborough University.
  The poster was awarded with the best student poster presentation of the fair.
